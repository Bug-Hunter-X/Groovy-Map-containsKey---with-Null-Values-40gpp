This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to how `containsKey()` handles null values within Maps. The `bug.groovy` file shows the unexpected behavior where `containsKey()` returns `true` even when the value associated with the key is `null`. The `bugSolution.groovy` offers a corrected approach using the `get()` method with null checks, ensuring robust handling of null values and avoiding unexpected results.
